# Annual Donation Tracking as part of the *Introduction to Database* course at the University of Jeddah.
It aims to support charitable organization in tracking annual donations, managing donors and recipients, and improving transparency.

## Project Description
Charitable organizations often face issues such as:
- Lack of transparency in donation handling
- Difficulty in generating reports for donors
- Mismangment of funds
- Inability to track recurring support or campaign effectiveness

This project solves these problems through a structured **relational database system**.

## Database Design
We modeled a normalized relational schema including:
- **Donor**
- **Donation**
- **Recipient**
- **Campaign**
- **Grant**
- **Delivery**
- **Broker** (for campaign managment)

Each entity includes relevant fields such as personal info, donation type and value, eligibility, campaign goal, and more.

This database project simulates a real-world donation tracking system and provides a practical foundation for understanding relational modeling and SQL design.
